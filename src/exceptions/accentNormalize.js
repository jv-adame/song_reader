//Normalize accented letters from artist's names in Genius.com's search results to match Spotify's artist naming convention
//For example Jhené Aiko's entire discography is cannot be analyzed without this document
//No need to do this to song titles, "Where Are Ü Now (with Justin Bieber) - Jack Ü" is a cited and functional example
